TourGuide Recorder is an addon to track the user as he quests, for later use in guide creation.

What it does:

* Record when a quest is accepted, turned in, and when each objective is competed
* Record the zone, subzone and coords for events that might need them
* Record when the player uses an item (for those "go zap 12 lizards with this thingmabob" quests)
* Provides @/tgr@ command to add manual notes to the record
* In-game panel to copy and clear the log, accessable with the @/tgr@ command

I'm looking for logs for all zones now that the cataclysm has hit.  Please email tgr@tekkub.net for details on how to submit your logs.
